About Me
======
------

My name is Zhan Keyang, and I am currently studying Economics at the [School of Economics and Management](https://em.seu.edu.cn/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/) (September 2021 - June 2024). Interestingly, before I started Economics, I also studied the knowledge of Law, Philosophy, and Psychology at the [School of Humanities](https://rwxy.seu.edu.cn/) (September 2020 - June 2021). If it is not unexpected, I will spend my Masterâ€™s career in the [Business School](https://nubs.nju.edu.cn/) of [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/), majoring in National Economics.
